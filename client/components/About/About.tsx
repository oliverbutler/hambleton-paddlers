        Established in 2002, Hambleton Paddlers is a family-friendly club
        offering a wide range of activities and events catering for everyone
        from complete beginners to experienced paddlers.
        <br /> <br />
        Hambleton Paddlers aim to introduce anyone to the pleasures of kayaking
        and canoeing in a safe environment. We promote the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/">British Canoeing</a> Award
        Scheme and for those who wish to aspire to the coaching side of the
        sport, we have an active support scheme in operation.

        Over the summer months Hambleton Paddlers Canoe Club is based at Carlton
        Lodge Activity Centre, where we hold our weekly lake-based Club
        sessions, that offer both structured training and fun based activities.
        <br /> <br />
        When the weather turns chilly, Hambleton Paddlers take to the waters of
        Richmond Swimming Pool to enhance our skills learnt ready for the next
        trip!
